# Threat-Intel Dashboard (Ready ZIP)

## What is included
- Next.js + TypeScript frontend skeleton
- Mock API: `pages/api/iocs.ts`
- Components, Zustand store, Tailwind setup
- **Note:** `node_modules` are NOT included (too large and cannot be fetched here).

## Quick start after extracting
1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Run: `npm install`  (this will download dependencies)
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

## If you want a truly zero-setup (node_modules included)
- I couldn't include `node_modules` here because of size and environment restrictions.
- If you need that kind of ZIP, I can guide you how to create it on your machine and upload to Google Drive/GitHub Releases.

## Need help?
Tell me if you want:
- A GitHub repo with these files and a deploy workflow
- A script to automatically install and run
